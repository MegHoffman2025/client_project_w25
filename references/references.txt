When prompted with “why is my skip to main not working” the ChatGPT listed common issues related to Skip to main. I did not include my code in this question, since I did not want ChatGPT to be writing any code for me. I only asked this question because I could not find the answer from any of the validators. 

The part of the response I used was :

“Missing or Incorrect Target ID
* Ensure your skip link (<a href="#main-content">Skip to Main Content</a>) matches the id of your main content container.
* Example: htmlCopyEdit<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to Main Content</a>
* <main id="main-content">
*     <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
* </main>
“
 This information was helpful for realizing that I had just used #main in my href, but had not included the id in my main.
